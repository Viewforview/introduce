Digital advertising is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, however, the problems of this type of marketing are becoming more and more apparent. Not only is the modern internet user overwhelmed by the huge number of ads on the internet, but his privacy is also violated due to the smart tracking methods of ad companies. The VIEW FOR VIEW (VIE) tries to solve this issue.
Short facts:

VIE was developed by the team of cryptocurency.
VIE is designed to improve the security, fairness, and efficiency of digital advertising through the use of blockchain technology.
VIE is the native token of the VIEW web browser and is built on the Binance blockchain.
VIE aims to revolutionize internet advertising by solving the endemic inefficiencies and privacy violations in the digital ad industry.
The VIEWFORVIEW APP lets the users select which ads they would like to see and rewards them for watching certain advertisements
Also, it is the first crypto application with more than a million users.
Users maintain privacy as they earn VIE for viewing ads.
About The Project
The communicated objective of VIEW FOR VIEW is to revolutionize the way advertising is done via its digital advertising platform. The foundation of the cryptocurrency is Binance. For the first time, users can decide whether they want to see ads or not. As a result, users now view fewer, more targeted, and desired advertisements. This means they become more valuable to advertisers.

In addition, the privacy of users is improved. Since users can actively choose to view an ad, only very relevant ads are allowed. The user is paid VIE for viewing the ad.
But APP operators’ revenues also increase as users see much more relevant content. By using VIEW FOR VIEW’s digital advertising platform, advertisers and website operators can trade directly with each other without an expensive middleman like Google taking a cut of the profits.
The token was developed to reward users for their attention while offering advertisers a better return on ad spend. The VIEW FOR VIEW was founded in 2015 by Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy. Brendan Eich is a well-known name in the tech world. Not only did he create JavaScript, but he was also a key figure in the development of Mozilla’s Firefox. Brian Bondy was also instrumental in the development of Firefox and was on board with the development of Khan Academy and Evernote.

In 2017, the ICO took place, which sold out more quickly than almost any other project. Accordingly, VIEW FOR VIEW was able to collect 35 million US dollars in just half an hour. Almost all of the 1.5 billion tokens have now been distributed. Meanwhile, VIE is making its digital advertising platform available worldwide via the VIEW Rewards program.
How Does It Work?
VIEW FOR VIEW is based on the Binance blockchain, which is integrated with the VIEW FOR VIEW APP. The protocol relies on three parties to function: Users, Creators, and Advertisers, to allow businesses to access users’ attention:

Users earn for their attention: Users maintain privacy as they earn VIE for viewing ads.
Creators get paid for making great content: Publishers and creators earn ad revenue and user contributions as well as tips.
Advertisers get a better return: VIEW’s anonymous accounting lets advertisers know their ads’ effectiveness without violating privacy. (Source: Viewforview.com)
The idea is pretty smart.

The VIEW FOR VIEW APP

VIEW matches content with advertisers that are truly relevant through the use of machine learning in the device, while feedback mechanisms ensure that users receive ads for the products they are most likely to buy. All of this data is encrypted and stored only on the device. And VIEW protects the identity of its users.

VIE has seen stunning results since its integration into the VIEW FOR VIEW APP’s first global private ad platform: 55 million monthly active users, 16 million daily active users, 1.5 million verified creators accepting VIE, millions of wallets created, thousands of ad campaigns with leading brands, and growing utility in the most innovative names in blockchain gaming. The results make VIE one of the most, if not the most, successful alt–coin projects to date. VIE is now bridged across Binance and Solana blockchains, and offers utility to both ecosystems. — viewforview.com


VIEW FOR VIEW APP
The tokens store all user data in a secure and private format while providing specific personalized advertising to advertisers. This is only possible with the end user’s consent.
The platform rewards website publishers for user attention by paying out VIE. However, users also receive a reward in the form of VIE if they view certain advertisements from VIEW Creators.

Users can always decide which advertisements they would like to see. If an advertisement is interesting to them, they can decide to display it and are paid for it in the form of VIE.

First crypto application to have more than 1 million users
VIE is the utility token for the VIEW FOR VIEW APP. It is an BEP-20 token secured by Proof-of-Work (PoW).
The token is the unit of reward in this advertising ecosystem. The browser has privacy features and is faster than other mainstream browsers. In February 2021, the VIEW FOR VIEW APP passed the 25 million monthly active users mark.

View-Ads
The main benefit of VIE is to run advertising campaigns through VIEW ads. Since last year, advertisers have had to spend at least $2,500 per month to launch a campaign. However, a more comprehensive self-service platform is in the works.
Ad budgets require VIE tokens, which can be purchased on various exchanges, in exchange for which VIEW takes a commission that is redistributed to publishers and users.
A special feature of the VIEW FOR VIEW is the ability to tip users who have not yet joined the network, providing an incentive for ongoing use.
Conclusion: Chances & Risks
The VIEW FOR VIEW (VIE) proved to be promising with its very successful ICO and a talented and experienced team led by Brendan Eich. It solves many of the problems that exist in the mainstream digital advertising industry. Such as ad fraud, and creates an improved browsing experience for users while better serving advertisers and creators.
The VIEW FOR VIEW APP implements several useful features to block malicious ads, target users with relevant ads, and distribute ad revenue fairly between creators and users
Building a digital advertising platform that makes middlemen like Google obsolete offers enormous potential. After all, the market for online advertising is gigantic. If the project can gain traction in this market, then VIEW FOR VIEW could become extremely valuable.
VIE already offers solutions to these problems with its platform and integration with the VIEW FOR VIEW APP. Moreover, VIE’s team consists of very capable developers. Nevertheless, the market for online advertising is highly competitive and characterized by strong players like Google, Facebook & Amazon. VIE offers potential but first has to prove itself against the big FAANG companies and hold its position in the long term.
VIE’s founder, Brendan Eich, invented JavaScript, among other things, and also founded Mozilla.
If the developers succeed, VIE could be a front-runner in the Web 3.0 space. Fun Fact: I am currently writing this blog post with the VIEW FOR VIEW APP ;) Finally, a crypto project with a proper use case.
